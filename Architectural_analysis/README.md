# Architectural analysis

### This contains scripts to plot the binding domains and to evaluate their contribution to the 3D architecture.

The scripts most_abundant_domain.py and plot_most_contributing_matrix.py use as input the file '1st_contribution.txt' generated by the script most_contributing_domain.py. So, most_contributing_domain.py should be run first.
